6.824: Distributed Systems Engineering
>####6.824: 分布式系统工程


What is a distributed system?
  multiple cooperating computers
  big databases, P2P file sharing, MapReduce, DNS, &c
  lots of critical infrastructure is distributed!
>#####什么是分布式系统？
>* 多台机器协作
>* 大数据、P2P文件共享、MapReduce、DNS等
>* 很多关键基础设施是分布式的。


Why distributed?
  to connect physically separate entities
  to achieve security via isolation
  to tolerate faults via replication
  to scale up throughput via parallel CPUs/mem/disk/net

But:
  complex: many concurrent parts
  must cope with partial failure
  tricky to realize performance potential

MAIN TOPICS

This is a course about infrastructure, to be used by applications.
  About abstractions that hide distribution from applications.
  Three big kinds of abstraction:
    Storage.
    Communication.
    Computation.
  [diagram: users, application servers, storage servers]
>##### 课程主题：这是一个基础课程，适用于应用程序。隐藏系统分布式复杂性进行抽象。抽象为如下三个方面：
>* 存储
>* 通信
>* 计算
>* [diagram: 用户，应用服务器，存储服务器]


A couple of topics come up repeatedly.
>##### 系统中下述的主题有可能会同时出现两三个。

Topic: implementation
  RPC, threads, concurrency control.
>##### 主题：实现
>* RPC, threads, 并发控制.


Topic: performance
  The dream: scalable throughput.
    Nx servers -> Nx total throughput via parallel CPU, disk, net.
    So handling more load only requires buying more computers.
  Scaling gets harder as N grows:
    Load im-balance, stragglers.
    Non-parallelizable code: initialization, interaction.
    Bottlenecks from shared resources, e.g. network.
>##### 主题：性能
>* 理想：可伸缩的吞吐性能，通过购买更多的机器，利用多核CPU、磁盘、网络等来实现
>* 扩展性变得困难随着N倍的增长：负载均衡、慢的掉队节点；无法并行化的代码；资源共享瓶颈、网络等

Topic: fault tolerance
  1000s of servers, complex net -> always something broken
  We'd like to hide these failures from the application.
  We often want:
    Availability -- app can keep using its data despite failures
    Durability -- app's data will come back to life when failures are repaired
  Big idea: replicated servers.
    If one server crashes, client can proceed using the other(s).
>##### 主题：容错
>* 上千的服务器，复杂的网络->这样总会出现一些问题；我们希望隐藏这些出现错误的问题从应用上。
>###### 我们通常希望：
>* 高可用--尽管数据出现失败app仍然可用
>* 持续可用--当失败被修复app的数据能够恢复到正常
>###### 更好的主意：备份服务器
>* 如果一个服务器出现问题，客户端能够继续使用其他正常备份服务器


Topic: consistency
  General-purpose infrastructure needs well-defined behavior.
    E.g. "Get(k) yields the value from the most recent Put(k,v)."
  Achieving good behavior is hard!
    "Replica" servers are hard to keep identical.
    Clients may crash midway through multi-step update.
    Servers crash at awkward moments, e.g. after executing but before replying.
    Network may make live servers look dead; risk of "split brain".
  Consistency and performance are enemies.
    Consistency requires communication, e.g. to get latest Put().
    "Strong consistency" often leads to slow systems.
    High performance often imposes "weak consistency" on applications.
  People have pursued many design points in this spectrum.
>##### 主题：一致性
* 通用的基础设施需求定义良好的行为。 例如： Get(k) 获取到的值应该是最近的 Put(k,v)设置的。
* 实现良好的行为是很困难的!
+ 各个备份服务器之间很难保持完全相同
+ 客户端可能在中途奔溃
+ 网络故障可能使得正常服务器无法连接；出现“脑裂”风险
* 一致性和高性能是相对的
+ 一致性需要通信，例如获取最后的Put()操作内容
+ 强一致性通常会导致系统变慢
+ 高性能一般会导致系统的“弱一致性”
* 人民已经研究了很多设计方法处理这些问题


CASE STUDY: MapReduce

Let's talk about MapReduce (MR) as a case study
  MR is a good illustration of 6.824's main topics
  and is the focus of Lab 1

MapReduce overview
  context: multi-hour computations on multi-terabyte data-sets
    e.g. analysis of graph structure of crawled web pages
    only practical with 1000s of computers
    often not developed by distributed systems experts
    distribution can be very painful, e.g. coping with failure
  overall goal: non-specialist programmers can easily split
    data processing over many servers with reasonable efficiency.
  programmer defines Map and Reduce functions
    sequential code; often fairly simple
  MR runs the functions on 1000s of machines with huge inputs
    and hides details of distribution
  
Abstract view of MapReduce
  input is divided into M files
  Input1 -> Map -> a,1 b,1 c,1
  Input2 -> Map ->     b,1
  Input3 -> Map -> a,1     c,1
                    |   |   |
                        |   -> Reduce -> c,2
                        -----> Reduce -> b,2
  MR calls Map() for each input file, produces set of k2,v2
    "intermediate" data
    each Map() call is a "task"
  MR gathers all intermediate v2's for a given k2,
    and passes them to a Reduce call
  final output is set of <k2,v3> pairs from Reduce()
    stored in R output files

Example: word count
  input is thousands of text files
  Map(k, v)
    split v into words
    for each word w
      emit(w, "1")
  Reduce(k, v)
    emit(len(v))

MapReduce hides many painful details:
  starting s/w on servers
  tracking which tasks are done
  data movement
  recovering from failures

MapReduce scales well:
  N computers gets you Nx throughput.
    Assuming M and R are >= N (i.e. lots of input files and output keys).
    Maps()s can run in parallel, since they don't interact.
    Same for Reduce()s.
  So you can get more throughput by buying more computers.
    Rather than special-purpose efficient parallelizations of each application.
    Computers are cheaper than programmers!

What will likely limit the performance?
  We care since that's the thing to optimize.
  CPU? memory? disk? network?
  In 2004 authors were limited by "network cross-section bandwidth".
    [diagram: servers, tree of network switches]
    Note all data goes over network, during Map->Reduce shuffle.
    Paper's root switch: 100 to 200 gigabits/second
    1800 machines, so 55 megabits/second/machine.
    Small, e.g. much less than disk or RAM speed.
  So they cared about minimizing movement of data over the network.
    (Datacenter networks are much faster today.)

More details (paper's Figure 1):
  master: gives tasks to workers; remembers where intermediate output is
  M Map tasks, R Reduce tasks
  input stored in GFS, 3 copies of each Map input file
  all computers run both GFS and MR workers
  many more input tasks than workers
  master gives a Map task to each worker
    hands out new tasks as old ones finish
  Map worker hashes intermediate keys into R partitions, on local disk
  no Reduce calls until all Maps are finished
  master tells Reducers to fetch intermediate data partitions from Map workers
  Reduce workers write final output to GFS (one file per Reduce task)

How does detailed design reduce effect of slow network?
  Map input is read from GFS replica on local disk, not over network.
  Intermediate data goes over network just once.
    Map worker writes to local disk, not GFS.
  Intermediate data partitioned into files holding many keys.
    Big network transfers are more efficient.

How do they get good load balance?
  Critical to scaling -- bad for N-1 servers to wait for 1 to finish.
  But some tasks likely take longer than others.
  Solution: many more tasks than workers.
    Master hands out new tasks to workers who finish previous tasks.
    So no task is so big it dominates completion time (hopefully).
    So faster servers do more work than slower ones, finish abt the same time.

What about fault tolerance?
  I.e. what if a server crashes during a MR job?
  Hiding failures is a huge part of ease of programming!
  Why not re-start the whole job from the beginning?
  MR re-runs just the failed Map()s and Reduce()s.
    MR requires them to be pure functions:
      they don't keep state across calls,
      they don't read or write files other than expected MR inputs/outputs,
      there's no hidden communication among tasks.
    So re-execution yields the same output.
  The requirement for pure functions is a major limitation of
    MR compared to other parallel programming schemes.
    But it's critical to MR's simplicity.

Details of worker crash recovery:
  * Map worker crashes:
    master sees worker no longer responds to pings
    crashed worker's intermediate Map output is lost
      but is likely needed by every Reduce task!
    master re-runs, spreads tasks over other GFS replicas of input.
    some Reduce workers may already have read failed worker's intermediate data.
      here we depend on functional and deterministic Map()!
    master need not re-run Map if Reduces have fetched all intermediate data
      though then a Reduce crash would then force re-execution of failed Map
  * Reduce worker crashes.
    finshed tasks are OK -- stored in GFS, with replicas.
    master re-starts worker's unfinished tasks on other workers.
  * Reduce worker crashes in the middle of writing its output.
    GFS has atomic rename that prevents output from being visible until complete.
    so it's safe for the master to re-run the Reduce tasks somewhere else.

Other failures/problems:
  * What if the master gives two workers the same Map() task?
    perhaps the master incorrectly thinks one worker died.
    it will tell Reduce workers about only one of them.
  * What if the master gives two workers the same Reduce() task?
    they will both try to write the same output file on GFS!
    atomic GFS rename prevents mixing; one complete file will be visible.
  * What if a single worker is very slow -- a "straggler"?
    perhaps due to flakey hardware.
    master starts a second copy of last few tasks.
  * What if a worker computes incorrect output, due to broken h/w or s/w?
    too bad! MR assumes "fail-stop" CPUs and software.
  * What if the master crashes?

For what applications *doesn't* MapReduce work well?
  Not everything fits the map/shuffle/reduce pattern.
  Small data, since overheads are high. E.g. not web site back-end.
  Small updates to big data, e.g. add a few documents to a big index
  Unpredictable reads (neither Map nor Reduce can choose input)
  Multiple shuffles, e.g. page-rank (can use multiple MR but not very efficient)
  More flexible systems allow these, but more complex model.

Conclusion
  MapReduce single-handedly made big cluster computation popular.
  - Not the most efficient or flexible.
  + Scales well.
  + Easy to program -- failures and data movement are hidden.
  These were good trade-offs in practice.
  We'll see some more advanced successors later in the course.
  Have fun with the lab!
